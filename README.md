# Surfs_up
 
## Overview of the analysis

W. Avy wants to determine if investing in a new bussiness in Ohau based in surf and ice cream will tourn out great. For this reason we'll analyse weather during the year to determine if business is sustainable during the top seasons of the year (June & December) and during the rest of the year without high demand. 

## Results

### June

This month seems to be the best season of the year for both bussiness. Mean weather of 74.94°F (23.85°C) would make the ice cream bussiness very attractive, Surf in Hawaii is one of the most requested turist attractions but there's a lot of other bussinesses similar so, in order to be profitable a great marketing campaing will be a plus. A points or frequent customer program could increase local demand.

### December

For this month, let's take in considerations that is one of the most crowdy season of the year. Even when weather it's not as perfect as in June (21.68°C) we could apply many strategies to improve bussiness and take advantages of the local culture events.

## Summary

Hawaii is one of the most attractive destinations around the world so, why not improve regular bussiness such as surf and ice cream. Results show that weather during high demand it's perfect to get a great quantity of customers. 

First let's know better Hawaiian culture that not only includes beach, for example King Kamehameha Celebration (June) are primarily local occasions. These events have a strong allure for visitors who want to get an authentic glimpse of Hawaii during their trip, we can take advantage of these types of local events to raise the level of business and create strong campaigns not only for foreigners but also for local people who attend cultural events on the island. 

"Events that feature local foods and agricultural products attract both locals and visitors. The Hawaii Food and Wine Festival on the islands of Hawaii, Maui and Oahu (October)". For this kind of small bussiness it turns amazing if you put your brand in festivals  or any kind of crowdly events. Think further with Ice creams, it' would be teh same as other Ice creams but your brand would be known by more people, it would have much more visibility and therefore higher sales. 

Think about the Honolulu Marathon (December), many visitors from around the world, maybe you not just sale Ice cream in December (When as we saw before it's not as demanded as in summer) you sale refreshing beverages, that becomes many sales.
